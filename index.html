				<h4>What is a Basic Income?</h4>
		
				<div class="ptag">A Basic Income is an unconditional, liveable wage for every citizen. If it doesn't meet the three metrics of 1) unconditionality 2) liveability and 3) for every citizen, then it's not a Basic Income.</div>
		
				<div class="ptag">But there have been several variations of Basic Income proposed throughout history, so how can you know this definition is the most "correct" one? The first thing to note is that one of the central claims of UBI advocates is that it would allow everyone to meet their basic needs without a job ("living is free but everything else still costs money"). If the wage given was conditional or unliveable then that wouldn't be possible.</div>
		
				<div class="ptag">Also when evaluated in pairs, these features already exist and wouldn't be a revolutionary new concept but a combination of the three of them would be. A conditional living wage for every citizen is called 'welfare' (I know it's hard to believe but some countries actually set their welfare rates at a living wage). An unconditional liveable wage for some citizens is called 'capital dividends' and it's only accessible to the wealthy. And an unconditional unlivable wage is what the Alaska Permanent Fund<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Permanent_Fund"><sup>1</sup></a> is and has been in place since 1980.</div>

				<h4>What would an implementation look like?</h4>
		
				<div class="ptag">While there is not a unanimously agreed upon implementation within the movement, most people tend to agree that it should be around the poverty line (Henderson Poverty Line is approximately $500/wk<a href="https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/publications/poverty-lines"><sup>1</sup></a>) and paid out in smaller, periodic payments (e.g. weekly or fortnightly, rather than annually).</div>
		
				<div class="ptag">In regards to how the payments are made, it could be a system as simple as having a database with all living Australian citizens and their bank accounts and sending a direct deposit of the same amount to each one automatically (given the rate is flat, groups such as parents and less abled people would need a additional payments through a separate service). Or it could be a more complex system that varies the rates depending on peoples living situations (e.g. parents, less abled) but with all rates above a given floor. Depending on implementation the net financial result of these two options could be the same, but there would be differences socially and politically.</div>
		
				<div class="ptag">Compliance services would have to ensure there are no duplicate payments and all recipients are alive, but these services largely already exist within the current Centrelink system.</div>

				<h4>What is the difference between a Guaranteed Basic Income and a Universal Basic Income?</h4>
		
				<!-- <div class="ptag">As with most definitions in politics these definitions are changing, subject to the context of use. It's common for terms to get misused or co-opted and that needs to always be kept in mind. 'Liberal' is a great example of this because in Australia it is the name of the mainstream right-wing political party and it therefore comes with certain right-wing connotations. In Canada it is the name of the mainstream left-wing political party and comes with very different connotations. In the US and UK, 'Liberal' is not the name of a major party and throughout history has been used to mean very different things.</div>
		 -->
				<div class="ptag"><!-- With that in mind,  -->In a modern, Australian context this is what the differences<!-- between Guaranteed and Universal --> are generally understood to be:</div>
		
				<div class="ptag"><span class="bold">Universal Basic Income:</span> tax more and provide an equal payment to every citizen.</div>
		
				<div class="ptag"><span class="bold">Guaranteed Basic Income:</span> tax less and ony provide payments to those below an income threshold.</div>
		
				<div class="ptag">In financial terms, theoretically both policies could have an equivalent net result (because your income would be the same if you were taxed more and you received some of it back, compared with if you were just taxed less to begin with) so while the 'cost' of one looks significantly bigger than the other on the balance books, the main difference is in the simplicity of implementation. Both systems would require administration on the 'taxation end' (in order to ensure everyone who should be paying tax is paying tax), but only the Guaranteed version requires administration on the 'income end'.</div>
		
				<div class="ptag">In emotional terms, means-tested welfare is a very degrading and dehumanising process that adds additional strain to people who are already struggling. It creates and then stigmatises a class of people who receive targeted welfare, which results in those programs being much easier to cut. When the welfare system is complex and difficult to understand, it becomes harder to mobilise a political defense against those cuts.</div>

				<div class="ptag">A Basic Income gives everybody the security to say "no" to unsafe, illegal, unpleasant or unethical working conditions and financial dependencies within abusive relationships. We teach our children the importance of consent in the bedroom, and it's time we extended the same values economically.</div>
		
				<div class="ptag">When people are free from forced work, they're free to do their best work. Many people today want to do something to improve themselves/their community/the world but their time and energy is drained generating profit for an employer.</div>

				<div class="ptag">200 years ago life expectancy was half of what it is today. 75 years ago programming languages didn't exist, 45 years ago machine learning had just been conceptualised, 30 years ago the internet became open to the public. The world is changing and the traditional rules for structuring society don't make sense any more.</div>
		
				<div class="ptag">Technology that is currently in its relative infancy such as self-driving cars, Amazon Go, farmbot and machine learning algorithms are predicted to put approximately 50% of the workforce out of a job within the next 20 years<a href="http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/about/news/new-study-shows-nearly-half-of-us-jobs-at-risk-of-computerisation"><sup>1</sup></a> and while all evidence shows that new "bullshit jobs"<a href="https://www.canberratimes.com.au/public-service/the-modern-phenomenon-of-bullshit-jobs-20130831-2sy3j.html"><sup>2</sup></a> will be invented to keep everyone busy, the reality is that we don't need everybody working to keep society functioning (and if we did then there wouldn't be more job-seekers than there are jobs<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/only-one-job-advertised-for-every-six-low-skilled-jobseekers-report"><sup>3</sup></a>).

				<div class="ptag">For all of human history up until a few hundred years ago, 80-90% of the population were farmers because they had to be in order to keep everybody alive.

If everyone received an unconditional liveable wage they would be able to spend as much (or as little) time and energy engaging in participatory democracy as they want, rather than work-drained activists using whatever free time they have outside of the 9-5.

				<blockquote>"One argues that a democratic society cannot persist unless it prepares all of its young with equal care to take on the full responsibilities of citizenship in a competent manner. We all depend on this political competence of our fellow citizens, since we put ourselves at the mercy of their collective judgment about the running of our society"<br> - David F Labaree</blockquote>
		
				<div class="ptag">Outside of participatory democracy, new options like a Direct Democracy would become a lot more viable if everyone who wanted to participate was guaranteed to have time to participate. And perhaps even more importantly, when we're free from work we're free to think about other things. We're free to dream bigger and ask structural questions about our society. How can we expect to solve the monumental problems we face today while we're all trapped in an endless treadmill of work? Every issue becomes easier to solve when people have the time and energy to care and get involved</div>

				<div class="ptag">One of the more interesting things about the idea is that it seems we don't have to. While wealthy people are renowned for tax avoidance<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers"><sup>1</sup></a>, some of the wealthiest people in the world are lining up to endorse the idea<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/27/what-billionaires-say-about-universal-basic-income-in-2017.html"><sup>2</sup></a> and unabiguously state that they should be taxed to pay for it<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM8l623AouM"><sup>3</sup></a>. These people largely made their wealth within tech industries and their reasoning typically is that the nature of work is changing and will continue to change due to advances in technology. They suggest that we are going to need a much stronger social safety net in order to effectively transition through the displacements they're predicting over the coming decades.</div> 
		
				<div class="ptag">But if you did want to make the case, one way is to point out that our economy is not a zero-sum game<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvskMHn0sqQ"><sup>4</sup></a>. It's time to move past the widely debunked trickle-down economic narriatives<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCvf8E7V1g"><sup>5</sup></a> to see that everyone does better when everyone does better. By distributing money to those who most need it (and spend it), we can increase the Velocity of Money<a href="http://tim-ellis.com/post/80787565427/on-stimulus-and-the-velocity-of-money-a-parable"><sup>6</sup></a> and therefore increase demand in the market<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT2JKf-rcTk"><sup>7</sup></a>.</div>

				<div class="ptag">This comes from a place of the most absolute defeatism. To say that the capital owners have all the power in the world and that nothing can be done about it and no policy can ever be achieved unless it upholds the current power structures. If these people have no interest in being a part of our society and only stay here to take advantage of our tax laws then we should welcome their leaving.</div>
		
				<blockquote>"If tax really were a pure burden, all rich individuals and companies would move to Paraguay or Bulgaria, where the top rate of income tax is 10%. Of course, this does not happen because, in those countries, in return for low tax you get poor public services. Conversely, most rich Swedes don't go into tax exile because of their 60% top income tax rate, because they get a good welfare state and excellent education in return. Japanese and German companies don't move out of their countries in droves despite some of the highest corporate income tax rates in the world (31% and 30% respectively) because they get good infrastructure, well-educated workers, strong public support for research and development, and well-functioning administrative and legal systems"<br> - Ha-Joon Chang</blockquote>
		
				<div class="ptag">But even if they do leave, they're not taking our land, roads, schools, workers, electricity grids or internet infrastructure. Everything at the core of what makes our society function. Our economy is driven by demand, not by supply - and by leaving and removing their business they would open up new markets for local entrepreneurs who want to participate in our society.</div>

				<div class="ptag">Hyperinflation is a very complex topic that isn't even fully understood by a lot of economists, but is generally understood to be related to the ratio between money in circulation and products in circulation<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afWqKcqntfs"><sup>1</sup></a>. Since most Basic Income proposals aren't funded through increasing the money supply that ratio would remain unchanged from the current ratio.</div>
		
				<!-- <div class="ptag">It is also generally understood that prices are related to market competition<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_(economics)"><sup>2</sup></a> and as long as there is genuine competition within a market then it is unlikely that prices would rise. With or without a Basic Income the government should be .</div>
		 -->
				<div class="ptag">The implication usually behind this line of logic is that if everyone has their basic needs met then it will crash the economy. If true, this is a convincing argument for moving to a radically different economic system. Another implication is that if poor people are given more money, then they end up having less money. The reasonable thing to do if that were the case would be to abolish Centrelink and the minimum wage in order to help poor people. If this line of reasoning was accurate, you could hypothetically counteract the hyperinflation by taxing people and reducing the money supply.</div>
		
				<div class="ptag">At the end of the day, we have to ask if hyperinflation is a legitemate critique or just a talking point fed to us by people who prefer the status quo. To figure out which it is, think about whether you would have opposed the abolition of slavery because it could have caused hyperinflation.</div>

				<div class="ptag">There will still be jobs. A Basic Income isn't an end to work, it is simply an end to forcing people to work in order to meet their basic needs. Regardless of how people choose to spend their time, we need an affirmative statement that says all people are unconditionally entitled to the resources they need to live.</div>
		
				<div class="ptag">The idea that people will become destitute and idle when given the option not to work is completely disconnected from any psychological analysis of motivation. For instance, looking at Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs"><sup>1</sup></a> a Basic Income would cover the two base levels relating to fundamental needs but would still leave many needs to be fulfilled that can't be achieved solely using money.</div>
		
				<blockquote>"Look at little children who haven't yet started school and therefore haven't yet had their curiosity and playfulness suppressed for the sake of work. Are they lazy? No. They are almost continuously active when not sleeping. They are always getting into things, motivated by curiosity, and in their play they make up stories, build things, create art, and philosophize (yes, philosophize) about the world around them.  There is no reason to think the drives for such activities naturally decline with age.  They decline because our schools, which value work and devalue play, drill them out of people; and then tedious jobs and careers continue to drill them out.  These drives don't decline in hunter-gatherers with age, and they wouldn't decline in us either if it weren't for all the work imposed on us"<br> - Peter Gray</blockquote>

				<div class="ptag">If work is as appealing as its advocates claim it is, then we should make it voluntary. When provided with an unconditional liveable wage people will choose to work because it brings them so much dignity. There is no way to know if this would actually happen, but there's also no way to know if work is the source of the value it's attributed to. We live in a society that puts an incredible emphasis on paid labour, it's possible that people gain social benefits from doing things that are considered socially acceptable.</div>
		
				<div class="ptag">We should also be extremely careful when addressing this issue because the implication is that those who do not work don't have dignity. Does this supposed to mean that children and less abled people don't have dignity? Or can dignity come from other sources that don't require you to sell your body?</div>

				<div class="ptag">It's not a question of being dependent on "government" but rather dependent on society (after all, the purpose of government is to enforce the rules that we collectively agree on as a society).

				<div class="ptag">The critique implies that we sit at an ideal equilibrium of government programs and any cuts to one ensures cuts to another. By this logic, someone advocating for free higher education should be to blame for cuts to healthcare. There is a double-standard here that if applied universally would mean we wouldn't support any change in government at all.</div>
		
				<div class="ptag">But let's be explicitly clear: a Basic Income shouldn't be used as an excuse to gut the current welfare system and leave people worse off than they are today. Programs such as the NDIS and public education would still play a critical role in a world with a Basic Income.</div>
		
				<div class="ptag">What is likely to happen is that many programs dedicated to serving people in poverty would have far less clients when every citizen is unconditionally receiving a livable wage.

				<div class="ptag">Given that the policy is universal by definition, a Basic Income can't be trialled because every trial will be insufficient. (Much like with vaccines against diseases, a vaccination against poverty would likely show significantly greater results due to "herd immunity"<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2015/feb/05/-sp-watch-how-measles-outbreak-spreads-when-kids-get-vaccinated"><sup>1</sup></a>). Given that all trials will be insufficient, you could say that we have had a trial running here in Australia for the past 70 years in the form of an various social security welfare payments that have successfully saved millions from abject poverty. 
				<!-- Unfortunately many others are not saved<a href="https://www.homelessnessaustralia.org.au/about/homelessness-statistics"><sup>2</sup></a>. -->
				</div>
		
				<div class="ptag">But Australian welfare is very heavily means tested so a reasonable question to ask is if non-means-tested welfare has been trialled. It has.

				<blockquote>"It is weird to me that the abolition of poverty is something that we need to prove would be good.

						Hi I'm Josh, I'm currently studying a double degree in Robotics Engineering and Computer Science. In my early twenties I explored the world while living in New York, London and Oslo. I've been living in Melbourne since the beginning of 2017 and started this Basic Income action group shortly after arriving. 
						<br><br>
						When I look at the level of technology and abundance around us today and yet how much poverty and unnecessary struggle continues, I can clearly see that my goal is to bridge that gap. I believe that it should be the governments job to actively put people out of a job so that they can spend their lives doing whatever is most valuable to themselves. There are many very different reasons to support Basic Income but that's where the conversation starts for me.

						Hello, I'm David, I live in Prospect, a leafy suburb in Adelaide with my wife Andrea. No kids or pets. I'm retired now after working on the land, and long term jobs in Road Surveys and Car seat manufacturing and in my latter years, in finance. I grew up on a farm and am still have a lot of country in me.
						<br><br>
						When I retired, I starting blogging on the net, and came across UBI. Well it jumped out at me actually, and I was compelled to research and study it to where I aspired to become an activist for it. I totally believe in the concept of a basic income, and am confident the hurdles and scepticism can be overcome, and that we, the general public can appreciate the obvious benefits it will bring and what's more how technological unemployment will necessitate a scheme like Universal Basic Income.
